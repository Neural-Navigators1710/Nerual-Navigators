# 🛠️ Engineering Log – 2025-07-19 – Servo Integration, Vision Refinement & Serial Sync

## 🧠 Goal

Integrate servo control with both PiCamera-based obstacle detection and ESP32-based color detection. Finalize visual filtering using calibrated HSV + shape rules and build two-way communication between Raspberry Pi and ESP.

---

## ✅ What I Did Today

- 🎯 **Integrated Pi → Servo Directional Control**
  - Calibrated and tested servo on Raspberry Pi via GPIO
  - Added logic in `main_obstacle.py` to turn 60° left or right based on detection
  - Used `RPi.GPIO` for PWM signal control

- 🔍 **Refined Color + Shape Detection**
  - Updated `obstacle_detection.py` with calibrated HSV for **Red** and **Orange**
  - Added shape filtering using:
    - **Aspect Ratio**: 0.5 – 0.8
    - **Extent**: 0.56 – 0.95
  - Ignored noise beyond **25 cm** distance
  - Verified accuracy of cuboid block detection (10×5×5 cm)

- 📡 **Established Pi–ESP32 Serial Communication**
  - ESP sends color signals like `"ORANGE"` / `"BLUE"` based on sensor data
  - Pi receives serial data in `main_open.py` and rotates servo accordingly
  - Handled noisy serial data with `.decode(errors='ignore')`

- 🧪 **ESP32 Color Sensor Logic**
  - Used Adafruit TCS34725 on I2C (GPIO21, GPIO22)
  - Wrote normalized RGB filter to distinguish:
    - 🟠 Orange → Turn Right
    - 🔵 Blue → Turn Left
  - Prints clean labels via serial

- 🔧 **General Improvements**
  - Smoothed detection with larger `GaussianBlur`
  - Reduced PiCamera resolution to 320×240 for faster processing
  - Printed AR, EXT, and DIST values in detection logs

## 👀 Observations

- HSV filtering is stable in constant lighting but may need dynamic adjustment in real match conditions.
- Serial input noise from ESP32 can occasionally cause decode errors — resolved with `errors='ignore'`.
- Shape detection reduced false positives drastically.
- Need better positioning for color sensor to avoid ambient light distortion.

## 📌 To Do Next

- [ ] Calibrate ESP TCS34725 sensor in real field conditions
- [ ] Add timeout failsafe if no signal received from ESP
- [ ] Begin basic lane/line detection logic for Open Challenge
- [ ] Automate movement decisions (not just servo, but full path logic)
- [ ] Start working on wiring diagrams and system flowcharts for documentation
