# 🤖 WRO Future Engineers 2025 – Self-Driving Robot

An intelligent, self-driving robot designed for the **WRO Future Engineers 2025** category. Built to think, adapt, and race through open and obstacle challenges — using real-time vision, autonomous decision-making, and multi-mode switching.

> 💡 Built with precision. Driven by code.

## 🚗 Features

- 🎯 Lane and wall detection using computer vision
- 🧭 Lap counting and zone recognition
- ⛔ Obstacle detection and bypass logic
- 🚦 Push-button start and ready LED indication
- 🛑 Accurate stop in original section after 3 laps
- 🔁 Seamless mode switching (Open ↔ Obstacle Challenge)
- 🔌 Modular ESP-based control for motors and sensors

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

1. **Install dependencies** (on Raspberry Pi):
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. **Connect hardware**
   - Attach PiCam, push button, and LED
   - Connect ESP to motor, servo, and color sensor
   - Optional: use I2C or UART between Pi ↔ ESP

3. **Start the robot:**
    ```bash
    python3 main.py
    ```

4. **Press the push button** when the LED turns green to begin.

## 🔁 Mode Switching

The robot has two files for two challenges: 
- **Open Challenge Mode**: lane following + lap tracking
- **Obstacle Challenge Mode**: activates object detection, path diversion

Use internal logic (lap counter or button press) to toggle mode at runtime.

## 🧠 Architecture

| Component     | Role                        |
|---------------|-----------------------------|
| Raspberry Pi  | Brain (vision + control)    |
| PiCam         | Eyes (OpenCV processing)    |
| ESP (external) | Muscles (motor/sensor control) |
| Gyro (BMA250) | Orientation + lap detection |
| LEDs + Button | Status & control interface  |
